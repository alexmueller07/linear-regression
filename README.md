# ðŸ“ˆ Linear Regression from Scratch (No Libraries)

This project implements linear regression **from scratch**, using only Python and math â€” no machine learning libraries like scikit-learn are used. It's a great educational example of how linear regression works under the hood.

## ðŸ§  What It Does

- Implements simple linear regression using basic Python and math
- Calculates slope and intercept manually using the least squares method
- Evaluates model accuracy using RÂ² (coefficient of determination)
- Works with multiple test datasets (`data.csv`, `data2.csv`, ..., `data8.csv`)

All logic is contained in `main.py`.

## ðŸ›  How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alexmueller07/linear-regression.git
   cd linear-regression
